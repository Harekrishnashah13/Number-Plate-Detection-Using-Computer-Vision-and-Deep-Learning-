# ðŸš˜ Number Plate Detection using Computer Vision & Deep Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting car number plates using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It aims to automate license plate recognition (LPR) by building an end-to-end pipeline from data processing to detection and visualization using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This model can be used for real-time vehicle surveillance, smart traffic monitoring, and automated toll systems.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: `pandas`, `numpy`, `glob`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Image Processing: `OpenCV`, `PIL`, `pytesseract`
  - Deep Learning: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`
  - Dataset Management: `datasets` from Hugging Face

   - Used layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, BatchNormalization, Dropout, and GlobalPooling

4. **Training**:
   - Optimized using `Adam` optimizer and `EarlyStopping`
   - Model checkpointing and tensorboard integration for monitoring

5. **Evaluation & Visualization**:
   - Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Displayed predictions with bounding boxes on test images
